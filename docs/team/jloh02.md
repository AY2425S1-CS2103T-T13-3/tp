### Project: PawPatrol

PawPatrol is a desktop app to help veterinary clinics in Singapore to manage their patient data.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to link pets. ([\#91](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/91)))
  * What it does: Allow users to link a pet to their respective owners.
  * Justification: When we search for an owner, we want to be able to see their pets and vice versa.

* **New Feature**: Added a find command for pets. ([\#71](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/71)))
  * What it does: Find pets in PawPatrol by name
  * Justification: When we want to find a pet, it is easier to search than to scroll through the entire list
  * Future enhancements to be added: Find by other attributes such as species and breed

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jloh02)

* **Fix**: Update validation to be more strict on some fields. ([\#149](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/149)))
  * Some fields did not allow specific texts e.g. names did not allow "\/", while others were not strict enough

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Update known issues and data file section ([\#142](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/142))
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `link` feature. ([\#112](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/112)))

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a CircleCI to the team repo
